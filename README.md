Time estimates opening files on a MacBook Pro 6-core intel Core i7; 16 gB ram:

- Denmark-latest.osm.zip file: 40 min
- Denmark-latest.osm.zip.obj: 2 min
- bornholm.osm.zip: 40 seconds
- bornholm.osm.zip.obj: 4 seconds

Other comments:
Files can be selected from settings under files in the app, or directly from launch in
App.java
By changing the string “filename” , and then rerun the program.
Notice when parsing bornholm.osm, there be writen a .obj file in the data map.
